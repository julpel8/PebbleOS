//! \brief Record microphone audio and store it on the watch.
//!
//! Unlike a dictation session, audio recording does not require a phone
//! connection: the captured audio is encoded and stored on the watch so it can
//! be transcribed or retrieved later. Only one recording can be active at a
//! time, and recording cannot run while a dictation session is in progress
//! (both use the single microphone).
//!
//! On platforms without a microphone, \ref audio_recording_start returns
//! \ref AUDIO_RECORDING_ID_INVALID and the other calls do nothing.
//! @{

//! Identifies a recording. Valid ids are non-zero.
